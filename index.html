<h1>valadaptive.dev</h1>

<p>
I'm Valerie, and I'm a JavaScript/TypeScript and Rust developer. My main interest is creative/multimedia software, although I'm interested in programming language design as well.
</p>


<h2>My projects</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p><a href="https://ntsc.rs/" class="external-link">ntsc-rs</a></p>
        <p>
            Currently my most popular project. It's a video effect that emulates the look of analog TV and VHS tapes. It started out as a Rust port of <a href="https://github.com/JargeZ/ntscqt" class="external-link">ntscqt</a>, and has apparently superseded it. While it runs entirely on the CPU, I've put quite a bit of effort into optimizing it.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p><a href="https://glypht.valadaptive.dev/" class="external-link">Glypht</a></p>
        <p>
            A comprehensive toolkit for packaging web fonts and making them small and fast. It subsets, instances, and compresses fonts, and even gives you CSS too.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/valadaptive/uwurandom" class="external-link">uwurandom</a></p>
        <p>
            A very silly project that generates an endless stream of nonsense using Markov chains (among other methods). It started as a joke kernel module (which lets you pipe catgirl musings directly from the `/dev/uwurandom` block device), but it's quite portable.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/valadaptive/sb3-js" class="external-link">sb3-js</a></p>
        <p>
            A greenfield runtime for the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" class="external-link">Scratch programming language</a>. It uses generator functions to implement Scratch's yield-and-resume behavior. It can run most complex Scratch projects flawlessly, and is about as fast as the official Scratch VM in Chrome/V8. It's much more lightweight than the official Scratch runtime, and could be useful for embedding Scratch projects in websites.
        </p>
    </li>

        <details>
            <summary>Half-baked projects</summary>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="https://github.com/valadaptive/crazystraw" class="external-link">crazystraw</a></p>
                    <p>Encrypted instant messaging over WebRTC, using a variation on the OTR protocol. I made this as a final project for my Network Programming course. It's very demo-y, and almost certainly not actually secure.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><a href="https://github.com/valadaptive/eurydice" class="external-link">eurydice</a></p>
                    <p>It's like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)" class="external-link">ML</a> mixed with dice notation. It's fun and it works, but it's kind of hard to write. A lot of the syntax was compromised by trying to make it look like dice notation.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><a href="https://github.com/valadaptive/chatterscribe" class="external-link">chatterscribe</a></p>
                    <p>A webapp for writing chatlog-based fiction. In retrospect, probably not that much easier than just writing plain text.</p>
